printReceiptInOrder(): .005 ms because the program needs to concatenate a lot of numbers and other values to strings
in the loop and send all that information to the system to print in the command terminal.

emptyCartReverseOrder(): .003 ms because the program is not doing many calculations, it's only really sending
information to the system to print out, with a few concatenations.
